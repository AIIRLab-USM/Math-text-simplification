"How do I efficiently compute a^b mod c? When b is huge, for instance 5^844325 mod 21? When b is less than c but still large, like 5^69 mod 101? When gcd(a, c) ≠ 1, like 6^103 mod 14? Are there any other tricks for evaluating exponents in modular arithmetic?"
"I am trying to prove from scratch that the rank of a torsion-free abelian group is exactly the size of a maximal linearly independent set. I have most of the proof done already, and am stuck trying to prove the following lemma: If X is a maximal linearly independent subset of a torsion-free abelian group A then A embeds as a subgroup of direct sum of Q over X. How do I prove this lemma?"
Computing the p-norm of a matrix A is defined as: ||A||_p = max {||Ax||_p : ||x||_p ≤ 1} = max_{x ≠ 0} {||Ax||_p / ||x||_p}. Is this problem convex or non-convex?
"Let G be a split reductive group over a field F. Fix a Borel subgroup and a maximal torus inside it. Let μ be a dominant cocharacter. I have seen several definitions of minuscule cocharacter of G. Are the following equivalent? If not, which one is the most common?"
"Let k be a field and V a projective variety over k. Suppose f = P/Q is a k-rational function and x is a k-point where f is defined. If Q(x) = 0, is it still true that f(x) is in k? If not, give a counterexample."
"I'm trying to evaluate the function F_v(x, y) = sum over all integers v of J_(mu - v)(x) * I_v(y), where J is the Bessel function of the first kind and I is the modified Bessel function. This looks similar to an identity involving only J. Does F_v(x, y) have a similar closed-form expression?"
"Lemma: If T is a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space H, then ||T|| = sup{|<Tx, y>| : x, y in H with ||x|| ≤ 1 and ||y|| ≤ 1}. Proof uses Cauchy-Schwarz and sequences to show the supremum reaches the operator norm. Conclusion: ||T|| = ||T*||."
"Suppose f is differentiable on the complex plane excluding the X-axis, and f'(z) = 0 in that region. Does it follow that f''(z) = 0 as well?"
"Let L1, ..., Ln be Galois extensions of a number field K, and let L be their compositum. A prime p of K splits in L if and only if it splits in all L_i. Does this still hold if the L_i are not Galois over K?"
"Let G be a split reductive group, and μ a cocharacter. Which definition of 'minuscule' is most commonly used among the ones involving root bounds, multiplicities in irreducible representations, or action via the adjoint representation?"
